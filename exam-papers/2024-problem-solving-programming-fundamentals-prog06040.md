    // one swap
    ****Your Code Here*****
}
```

### Question 2  

**(Total Marks: 30)**

Write an **ALGORITHM** for the following program:

The program allows the user to input the `month_number` using appropriate `JOptionPane` and returns the name of the month as a string.

(e.g., `1` for January, `2` for February, etc.)

The program should write and call the method `getMonthName` to achieve the desired functionality using a `switch` statement.

### Question 3  

**(Total Marks: 40)**

An employee's annual salary is to increase by a fixed percentage at the end of each year of his employment.

Write a program that will enter an `employee_Number`.

A **Sentinel** value of `-1` must be entered to terminate the list of employees.

For each employee, enter their starting **salary** and their **percentage increase** (e.g., 0.05).

The program should then display a message showing their new annual salary incremented with their **percentage_increase**, calculated using the formula below:

```java
annual_Salary += (annual_Salary / 100) * percentage_Increase;
```

You are also required to calculate and output the **total salaries** paid by the company for all its employees.
